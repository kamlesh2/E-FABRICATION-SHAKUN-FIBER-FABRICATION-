# E-FABRICATION (SHAKUN FIBER & FABRICATION)

ðŸ“¡ In today's era of the Internet, there is no E-Commerce website for fabrication so with the help of E-FABRICATION we can bring the fabrication business an E-Commerce portal. All the products can be bought and sold using this service. Seller and consumer can be directly connected.

ðŸ›’ Our main objective is to make a portal (both Android and a website) through which consumers, sellers, and manufacturers can communicate with each other efficiently. Consumers can specify their needs online to the manufacturer or the seller, and make their work done online via our portal.
